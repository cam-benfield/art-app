# README - Ruby on Rails Project
## Author: Cam Benfield

A Rails App that utilizes the Smithsonian's collection to show the user information linked to the piece.

This project is largely complete, as it was intended as a practice for API calls. I may continue work on it to integrate other APIs, but I'm not sure just yet.

## Deployment instructions

Register for a Smithsonian API Key at [https://api.data.gov/signup/](https://api.data.gov/signup/).

Place that API Key into a directory in ``art-app/.secret/smithsonian.key``.

``bundle install``
